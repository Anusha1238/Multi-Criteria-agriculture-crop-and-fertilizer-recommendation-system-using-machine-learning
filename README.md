#Major Project–Readme-File
# Title: Multi Criteria agriculture crop and fertilizer recommendation system using machine learning

## Project Idea:
The aim is to develop a system that recommends the optimal crop and corresponding fertilizer based on various criteria such as soil type, weather conditions, crop rotation history, market demand, and farmer preferences. The system will use machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multi Linear Regression, K- Nearest Neighbour.

## Modules included in our Project:
   1.Crop Recommendation Model
   
   2.Fertilizer Recommendation Model
   
**1. Crop Recommendation Model:**
    Train models (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees) using historical data to predict suitable crops for given conditions.
**2. Fertilizer Recommendation Model:**
    Develop models to recommend appropriate fertilizers based on soil nutrient deficiencies and crop requirements

## Functionality of the project:
   1. sign-in
   2. Crop recommendation data input
   3. crop output
   4. Fertilizer recommndation data input
   5. Fertilizer output

      
**1. sign-in**
  a) A farmer visits the sign-in page and enters their registered email and password.
  b) The form validates the inputs; if valid, the credentials are sent to the server for authentication.
  c) Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the dashboard where they can access the crop and fertilizer recommendations.

 **2. Crop recommendation data input**
 The crop recommendation data input process is a crucial part of the multi-criteria crop and fertilizer recommendation system. This process involves collecting 
 various types of data related to soil, weather, crops, market conditions, and farmer preferences. Below is a detailed description of how this data input functionality can be designed and implemented.
### Soil Data:
   pH level
   Nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
   Soil type (e.g., clay, sandy, loamy)
   Moisture content
### Weather Data:
   Current temperature
   Rainfall
   Humidity
   Sunlight hours
### Crop Data:
  Historical crop data (previous crops grown in the field)
  Crop rotation history
  Preferred crops
### Farmer Preferences:
  Preferred crops
  Financial constraints
  Resource availability (e.g., irrigation facilities, machinery)

  ## 3.crop output:
  Based on the input data provided the suitable crop is recommrnded.

  ## 4. Fertilizer recommndation data input:
  The fertilizer prediction data input process involves collecting data necessary for making accurate and tailored fertilizer recommendations based on specific 
 soil and crop conditions. This process is essential for optimizing crop yield and ensuring sustainable farming practices. Below is a detailed description of the 
 data input functionalities for fertilizer prediction.
  ###  Soil Data
    pH Level: Determines the soil's acidity or alkalinity, influencing nutrient availability.
    Nutrient Levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium): Indicates the current nutrient status of the soil.
    Soil Type: Identifies the texture of the soil (e.g., clay, sandy, loamy).
    Organic Matter: Provides information on the organic content in the soil.
    Moisture Content: Measures the water content in the soil.
###  Crop Data
    Crop Type: Specifies the type of crop currently being grown or planned to be grown.
    Growth Stage: Indicates the current growth stage of the crop (e.g., germination, vegetative, flowering, harvesting).
###  Environmental Data
    Weather Conditions: Includes data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, and sunlight hours.
    Irrigation Practices: Information on the irrigation methods and frequency used by the farmer

   ## 5. Fertilizer output:
         Based on the input data provided the suitable Fertilizer is recommrnded.

## Conclusion
The Project try to get best crop and fertilizer recommendation with the help of machine learning. For the calculation of accuracy many machine learning techniques were imposed or used. Numerous algorithms were used on datasets to get the best output which leads to best crop and fertilizer recommendation for particular soil of particular region. This system will help farmers to visualize crop yields based on that climatic and subsistence boundaries Using this farmer can decide whether to plant that crop or to look for another crop if yield forecasts are incorrect. hus, this enables farmers to make the right choice in choosing a crop farming so that the agricultural sector can develop with new ideas.

## Future Scope
For the upcoming updates the project can use deep learning techniques for plant diseases prediction with the help of images and we can also implement IOT techniques for getting contents of soil directly from the fields. Future Work on this can add many options such as:
• Diagnosis and prevention of plant diseases, predicting plant species.
• Current Market Conditions and analysis for information on crop market rates, production costs, fertilizer.
